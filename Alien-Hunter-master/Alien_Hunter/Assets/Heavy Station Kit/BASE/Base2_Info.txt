Heavy Station Kit base

-----------------
B  A  S  E   2.21
-----------------

WHAT'S NEW

The huge loads are distributed on the strong support pillars, securing space for the bunker or the center of operations. This heavy looking interior/exterior/top-down Kit is made to suit extreme environments - Space, Underwater, Underground, and On-ground.

What should You expect from 2.21 version?

ENHANCED EDITION

MODELING

The new look for many objects. Flat surfaces got less tris. Round ones like the railings got more. To widen the possibilities new objects were added.

MAPPING

To reduce the drawcalls, most models were packet into themes. Each theme is a single Material.
Some UVs has a bit of free space. This is reserved for future updates, so adding new objects will not require additional material.

TEXTURING

PBR was implemented - in a way as we think it should be.
All the materials now has Metallic, Height and Occlusion maps, in addition to Albedo, Normal, and if it fits, Emission.
